# git fetch

> git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository

* The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.   
  将远程仓库内容下载到本地仓库。
* Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.   
  用来查看远程仓库和本地仓库的不同

* Git isolates fetched content as a from existing local content, it has absolutely no effect on your local development work. it doesn’t force you to actually merge the changes into your repository.  
  对你本地的任何分支都没有任何影响。
